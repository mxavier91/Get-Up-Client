<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>

There weren't any unsolved issues, I wasn't able to solve the issue with my "Previous Workouts" button. When a user clicks on that button and doesn't have any users, there should be some type notification that tells the user that there isn't any workout, which I need to fix.

<h2>Planning</h2>

When planning this project I wanted to take it slowly, and take it day by day. Each day, in the morning, I planned out what I should and shouldn't be working on. I started by making sure I could do CRUD on both my auth and my resource. Over the weekend, I  continued to test my CRUD. Once I realized that I coud CRUD on both my front-end and Back-end I decided to focus on some of my bonus features. I was able to get one of my features done, which was allowing users to track their current workout. But I wasn't able to get to other features such as socail media.

<h2>Things to Add with more Time</h2>
If I had time, I would add a social aspect to my site. I originally wanted to allow users to see other users, which they can, and I wanted to allow users to add others as friends and like each other workout logs. I had to eventually scrap the idea, because I felt that another feature was more important, and I ran out of time.
