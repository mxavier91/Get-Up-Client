<h2>Things to Add with more Time</h2>
If I had time, I would add a social aspect to my site. I originally wanted to allow users to see other users, which they can, and I wanted to allow users to add others as friends and like each other workout logs. I had to eventually scrap the idea, because I felt that another feature was more important, and I ran out of time.
